 * page, which is exactly the failure a second list guarantees eventually.
 *
 * So: one list. Add a module here and it appears in the switcher, in the
 * switcher menu, and as a tile on the home page. Its tile shows a count when
 * the home page knows how to count it, and its description otherwise — a new
 * module is never invisible while waiting for someone to write the query.
